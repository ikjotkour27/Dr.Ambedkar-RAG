The Second edition of this Essay appeared in 1937, and was exhausted
within a very short period. A new edition has been in demand for a
long time. It was my intention to recast the essay so as to incorporate
into it another essay of mine called “Castes in India, their Origin and
their Mechanism”, which appeared in the issue of the Indian Antiquary
Journal for May 1917. But as I could not find time, and as there is very
little prospect of my being able to do so and as the demand for it from
the public is very insistent, I am content to let this be a mere reprint
of the Second edition.
I am glad to find that this essay has become so popular, and I hope
that it will serve the purpose for which it was intended.
